# C_Strain_Rate_to_Vz_MarkEWillis_SEG_DISC_2022

 This software demonstrates the conversion of strain rate to particle velocity.

This software is a part of the Society of Exploration Geophysicists Distinguished Instructor Short Course given by Mark E. Willis in 2022-2023.

It was written with MATLAB 2022a using guide. The main function is C_Strain_Rate_to_Vz_MarkEWillis_SEG_DISC_2022.

You can install the application directly into your Matlab session using the C_Strain_Rate_to_Vz_MarkEWillis_SEG_DISC_2022.mlappinstall file.
